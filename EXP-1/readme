## 📖 About
This project trains a CNN to classify images into 10 categories:
```
airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
```

It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images.

---

## 📊 Dataset
CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset for image classification, containing:
- **50,000** training images
- **10,000** test images
- 10 distinct classes

Dataset source: [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
The CNN architecture used:
```
Input (32x32x3) → [Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling] × 2 → Conv2D → ReLU → Flatten → Dense → Output (Softmax)
```

Layers:
- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- 2 MaxPooling layers
- 1 Fully connected hidden layer
- Output layer with 10 classes

---

## ⚙️ Installation
### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-image-classification.git
cd cnn-image-classification
```

2. **Run the training script:**
```bash
python cnn_classification.py
```

3. **(Optional) Visualize training performance:**
```bash
python plot_results.py
```

---

## 📈 Results
After training for 10 epochs, you should see an output similar to:
```
Epoch 10/10
...
Test accuracy: 0.75 (example)
```

You can visualize the training/validation accuracy and loss using the generated plots.
