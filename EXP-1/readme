# 🧠 CNN Image Classification using CIFAR-10

This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also includes functionality to test the model on custom images (e.g., a cat photo).

## 🔬 Lab Objective

To understand and implement the working of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks using a standard image dataset (CIFAR-10).

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: A collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- Classes: `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`
